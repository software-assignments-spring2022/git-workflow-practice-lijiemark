## What is interesting about MetaVerse? ##

I've always been interested in the idea of Metaverse, and this article gives a very interesting presentation of which stage the concept of Metaverse is in its development. 

1. Like early stage of internet: 
People have been talking about Metaverse as the next future of the internet (or it's a video game, as the article put it, or a VR version of zoom.) It is interesting to see how it compares "the metaverse" to "the internet" in the 1970s, as it's a developing idea and technology that's at its infancy but has the potential in shifting the ways people connect with each other. 

2. Like early stage of computer / cinema:
The technology associated with metaverse is virtual reality. Just like Metaverse, the development of virtual reality is still at an earlier age. As an entertainment medium, it resembles the early development of films; and the headsets of VR equipment are like the early stages of computers -  Although with all its wonders, VR headsets are still quite chunky and uncomfortable. 

Therefore, it's interesting to think about Metaverse as the future but most of its elements still need time to develop, and hopefully, it won't take too long.

## Comment by Zilong Jiang
The term, Metaverse, to me is very empty now. Most people criticize the idea of Metaverse by pointing out that it is nothing concrete yet but something that tech companies leverage to attract more investments. It is highly expected tha metaverse will be achieved by mass production and usage of VR/AR headsets, such as the ones that Facebook have been developing, but many people are skeptical about whether VR/AR headsets will be a success in the future due to uncomfort of wearing them. Elon Musk once raised his questions on metaverse in a recent interview, claiming that it will not be successful because people tend to prefer in-person activities to virtual experiences in metaverse. My opnion is that we still need to wait and see how the development of technology will be, and I think the key to success largely depends on breakthroughs in hardware development. There may be a truly virtuous world will be available to us in 10 years, or there may not.
